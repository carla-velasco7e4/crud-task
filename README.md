# Flagbit Company Activity - MVC CRUD Application
Welcome to the README for our project developed at Flagbit! This application represents a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

## Project Overview
This project showcases a CRUD application developed within the context of Flagbit, designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts of software development. The application is structured in accordance with the MVC pattern, allowing for clear separation of concerns between the data model, user interface, and application logic.

## Pseudocode Implementation
In order to maintain the focus on the core exercise and prevent being sidetracked by potential errors that could complicate the ideal exercise, we've implemented the application's logic in pseudocode.

## Form Actions and Routing
Throughout the application, all forms have been set with the "action" attribute pointing to a central dispatcher, known as "FormDispatcher." This component handles the routing of requests to their respective controllers, enabling efficient management of user interactions and maintaining a clean codebase.

## Session-Based Data Storage
In lieu of a database integration, we've chosen to employ session-based data storage. This allows us to simulate data persistence during the application's runtime without introducing the complexity of integrating a database system. This decision has been made to maintain a focus on illustrating the MVC structure and application flow.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive understanding of the MVC architectural pattern while showcasing the implementation of a CRUD application. By using pseudocode and session-based data storage, we aim to highlight the underlying concepts without dedicating excessive time to potential errors that could hinder the core exercise. We hope this project serves as a valuable learning tool for understanding software design and development principles.
